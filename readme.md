**Objective:** `CREATE`, `READ`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` books using AJAX and Handlebars templating.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repo, and clone it into your `develop` folder on your local machine.
2. Follow the challenges from the <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-24/modules/tree/master/week-03-resetful-server-express/day-01" target="_blank">CRUD and RESTful Resources</a> modules. By the end of the challenges, **your user should be able to:**
  * See a list of all books
  * Create a new book
  * Update an existing book
  * Delete an existing book
3. Make sure to take advantage of Bootstrap for a good UX.

## Submission

* As you make code changes, frequently commit and push to GitHub.
* At the end of the day, once you've finished the **challenges from both modules**, make a pull request from your fork to the original repo.
