In this lab you will CRUD resources using AJAX and a RESTful JSON API. Your goal is to `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete` books, and to render those books to the page using jQuery and AJAX.

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repo, and clone it into your `dev` folder on your local machine.
2. By the end of the challenges, **a user should be able to:**
  * See a list of all books (aka the `index` page)
  * `create` a new book
  * `read` a book :)
  * `update` an existing book
  * `delete` an existing book
3. Make sure to take advantage of Bootstrap for a good UX.

## Recommended

While you're developing a library, treat it as a real-world project. As you run into issues with our API add them to a list of problems you can research later (e.g. "I found it difficult to find documentation on what was returned from the API").

Prove to us you've read the document by including your list of 5 issues and any supporting references from the document in your submission pull request.

## Submission

* As you make code changes, frequently commit and push to GitHub.
* Please submit this lab as a pull request.
