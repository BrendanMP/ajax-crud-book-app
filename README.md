In this lab you will CRUD resources using AJAX and a RESTful JSON API. Your goal is to `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete` books, and to render those books to the page using jQuery and AJAX.

### Getting Started

1. Fork this repo, and clone it into your `dev` folder on your local machine.

2. As you tackle the user stories below, make sure to commit frequently and push your changes to github.

3. Finally, make sure to style your page using css & bootstrap so that it's nice to use! Feel free to come up with your own design, or go off the screenshot below.

### User Stories

**A user should be able to...**

* See a list of all books (aka the `index` page)
* Fill out and submit a form to `create` a new book
* `read` a book :)
* Modify and submit a form to `update` an existing book
* Click a button to `delete` an existing book

And most importantly, submitting a form should never cause the page to refresh!

### Recommended

There are a lot of gotchas you'll encounter as you CRUD your books! As you run into issues with our API add them to a list of problems you can research later (e.g. "I found it difficult to find documentation on what was returned from the API").

Prove to us you've read the document by including your list of 5 issues and any supporting references from the document in your submission pull request.

And don't forget to take a look at the solution branch! (Watch out! You might learn a thing or too.)

### Submission

* As you make code changes, frequently commit and push to GitHub.
* Please submit this lab as a pull request.
